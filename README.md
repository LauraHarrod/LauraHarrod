- 👋 Hi, I’m @LauraHarrod
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and API at the moment, but I'm open trying out new things I may not have considered otherwise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with special attention to how it is applied to machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I'm able, however I'm currently best at observing and learning. My goal on Github for now is to become familiar with colaborative workflow standards and curtesies. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Laura@harrod.life
- ⚡ Fun fact: All you need to make a basic soap from absolute scratch is ash, water, and fat.
